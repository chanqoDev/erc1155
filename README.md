# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby 0x4e639f28f3...

npx hardhat verify --network mainNet 0x4e639f28f33...

npx hardhat verify --network rinkeby 0x79F565CE...
